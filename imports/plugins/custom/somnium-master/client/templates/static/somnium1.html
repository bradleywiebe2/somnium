                        <p>Get into the zone: With two different firmness grades of springs in each mattress, Somnium’s zoned support cradles every contour of your body while you dream: Softer springs allow the shoulder to comfortably sink into the mattress while firmer ones actively support the lumbar spine. It's a task metal coils aren't up to. Ours are.</p><br>

                        <p>Made from high-tech TPEE (or Thermoplastic Polyether-Ester Elastomer, for long), a material commonly used in high-performance athletic gear, they are designed for superior support and flexibility. Imagine the strength of a ski boot and the comfort of a sport shoe offering perfect support in all the right places.</p><br>

                        <p>One added bonus: The springs’ hourglass design eliminates disruptive motion transfer. Eat your heart out, metal! </p><br><br>

                        <p>Our springs are big on spooning. They are the only ones available in two firmness grades to cradle every contour of your body while you dream: Softer springs allow the shoulder and pelvis to sink into the mattress while firmer ones actively support the lumbar spine. It's a fine-tuned task metal coils just aren't up to. Ours are.</p><br>

                        <p>Made from the highest grade TPEE (or Thermoplastic Polyether-Ester Elastomer, for long), a material used in the aviation and automotive industries and high-performance athletic gear, they were designed to exceed your expectations of support and flexibility. You get the strength of a ski boot with the bounce and comfort of a sports shoe. The result is support that is literally the most flexible in the industry: Structural strength superior to metal's in a sleek hourglass shape with sheer limitless 3D flexibility.</p><br>

                        <p>And the cherry on top: Our spring's design also eliminates motion transfer. Eat your heart out, metal! </p><br><br>

                        <p>We are clean freaks in the bedroom. That's why we designed a mattress with a smooth, tufting-free surface to ensure that there are neither nooks nor crannies for dirt and dust bunnies to hide in.</p><br>

                        <p>And because we want to keep things neat, our durable rayon-blend covers are removable and can be washed as often as you want to -- and as hot as any trace of last weekend's breakfast in bed might require. Being able to keep your bed pristine is genius; making the job easy with a cover that zips into two pieces you can machine wash at home ensures you may actually give it a try.</p><br>

                        <p>And while cleanliness might be next to Godliness, we are also keen on comfort and health. That's why our cover features a strip of airy mesh running the perimeter to help with ventilation and the fabric is free of toxins, dyestuff, flame retardant or harmful chemicals.</p><br><br>

                        <p>Foams can be a scary proposition. Many bring chemicals into your home, off-gas, smell of glue, or are bad for the environment. Our top-of-the-line foam is toxin-free, safe cold foam that is made using water vapors and air pressure instead of smelly injection gases.</p><br>

                        <p>Plus, being earth-friendly and benign by design demanded that we incorporate the renewable resource soy into our foam and only use solvent-free adhesives to assemble it. So we did.</p><br>

                        <p>The result is excellent news for your bedroom: Our highly resilient foam naturally never off-gases and it is pre-compressed to create a breathable open-pore structure. This structure helps overheated sleepers by allowing better airflow for a cooler sleep environment. It also prevents dips and it offers extra elasticity and density, allowing us to encase our sleek 8-inch bed in only a slender 2-inch layer of foam without forgoing comfort.</p><br><br>

                        <p>Sweet dreams are based on this: An even, supportive foundation for your mattress to rest on.</p><br>

                        <p>That's the simple concept behind our Somnium box. A look-alike to traditional box springs at first glance, it keeps a low profile of 8” but is big on clever design: Metal-free like our mattress and hand-made to order, the sturdy base is topped with solid wood slats that are spaced a good air gap apart and upholstered in our airy mesh to promote best-in-class ventilation.</p><br>

                        <p>Grand as the box is, our mattress doesn’t need it for comfort. So feel free to pair your Somnium with the supportive surface of your choice, whether it is a firm slatted frame with gaps of 2" or less, a sensibly-used adjustable base, a platform or - in a pinch - your living room floor.</p><br>

                        <p>We get it: Not everyone craves firm, active support quite like we do. While we strongly believe a mattress should always deliver proper ergonomic support, we also understand that ‘some like it soft’.</p><br>

                        <p>Luckily the two aren’t mutually exclusive. We got you covered with our new 1.5” latex topper. An optional accessory to a firm or regular Somnium mattress, it adds just enough of a plush, cloud-like feel without jeopardizing the underlying support or adding bulk to the minimalist lines of a low profile bed frame.</p><br>

                        <p>Zoned to perfectly match the zoning of our mattress and clad in a removable and washable zippered cover, the topper is made in Southern California from American-made Dunlop latex and is available in all US, European and select custom sizes.</p><br><br>

                            <li>Take your time: Give your body 2-3 weeks to adjust when you switch from a different mattress style or firmness.</li>
                            <li>Put the mattress in its (proper) place: Our beds contain all the necessary support technology; all you need to add is a flat, even surface for it to rest on. Suitable choices are our box base, platform beds, slatted frames (max 2.5" gaps) or even your bedroom floor. Uneven surfaces, box springs or overly soft slats are unsuitable since the mattress will contour to their uneven shape.</li>
                            <li>Flip your mattress once a quarter for most even wear. Somniums are dual-sided so please alternate between head-to-toe and side-to-side rotations for most even wear.</li>
                            <li>Practice clean sleep! To keep your new bed pristine, you can machine-wash the cover in warm water on the gentle cycle. Line drying is ideal.</li>                            <li>Zipping the cover into two pieces makes washing a breeze. Once dry, zip the top back in place, flip the mattress and remove the other half.</li>
                            <li>When moving the mattress, please make sure not to fold or bend it; when storing it, please store it horizontally.</li>
