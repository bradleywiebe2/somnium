                        <p>European design, American-made.<br>
                        Our sleek, low-profile mattress combines minimalist beauty and comfort with innovative technology and proprietary materials to create the ideal sleep environment.
</p><br>

                        <p>Superior functionality is paramount, so each component inside your Somnium is sourced to fulfill best in class requirements. Our mattress is designed to support the body’s natural nighttime movement with patented springs made from high-tech elastomer. Earth friendly and benign by design, our foam doesn’t off-gas and helps overheated sleepers keep cool. The mattress cover can be zipped off and machine-washed to keep the sleep environment pristine.</p><br>

                        <p>Our cutting-edge components are based on a European design and the high-tech springs come from Germany. Our fabric and foam are made by family businesses in the United States, and each Somnium is hand-assembled in Los Angeles.</p><br>

                        <p>Somnium mattresses are available in all standard US and European sizes, as well as custom orders for adults, children and babies. So no matter how big or small the bed of your dreams is, we are here to support you.</p><br><br>
