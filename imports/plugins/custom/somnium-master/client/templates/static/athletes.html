                        <p>Better Sleep = Better Performance<br>
                        Your physical performance is directly related to the quality of your sleep. Studies have shown that a good night’s rest helps improve key training elements like reaction times, skill memory, and mood. Plus, as any athlete who has really shredded a session at the gym knows, recovery is also important. Somnium is your training equipment for the night.</p><br><br>

                    <h2>Sleep and Performance</h2>
                    <p>Recent Stanford University studies have proved that quality sleep gives athletes the competitive edge. Researchers asked athletes to set a sleep goal of 10 hours a night. Here’s what they found:</p>

                            <li><i class="fa fa-circle"></i>Football: 40-yard dash and 20-yard shuttle times dropped. Players reported better energy levels.</li>
                            <li><i class="fa fa-circle"></i>Tennis: Sleep = Ace! Players saw their sprint times decrease and accuracy of their serves increase.</li>
                            <li><i class="fa fa-circle"></i>Basketball: Free throw and three point shot accuracy improved dramatically after more sleep.</li>
                            <li><i class="fa fa-circle"></i>Swimming: Teams saw better speed, reaction time, turn times and kick strokes after sleeping more.</li>

                    <p>Here’s the lesson: sleep not only helps your body recover from its athletic exertions, but it also helps your mind recover. You will think faster and more strategically, with better focus. Whether you are an Olympian or a weekend warrior, better sleep equals better results.</p>

The bed is firm and airy perfect for hot days... I also really like that there is zero metal in the mattress. Beds with metal in them usually really irritate my back.</p>

                        <p>My husband and I thought we had a comfortable bed until our Somnium mattress arrived. I'm a light sleeper and I've never slept better. I dont feel his every movement and the mattress remains cool allowing us to sleep more soundly. I feel the difference and wake up in the morning more refreshed than before.</p>
