                    <h2>Warranty</h2>
                    <div class="txt">
                        <p>Somnium warrants that our mattresses will provide use free from defects in workmanship and materials for a period of ten years from the initial date of purchase. This is a limited, prorated warranty and provides coverage as follows:</p><br>

                        <p>During the first five years Somnium will replace or repair all defective parts on any mattress at no cost to the customer. During the following five-year period, customers may replace the defective mattress by paying Somnium the applicable replacement fee: In year six, that fee will be 50 percent of the current retail price for the same product or, if the product has been discontinued, the current retail price of a comparable model. In year seven that percentage rises to 60 percent, in year eight and nine to 70 and 80 percent, respectively. Warranty concludes after year ten with a 90 percent fee. The replacement fee and/or any warranty shipping or handling charges are due and payable to Somnium before shipping of any replacement product will take place.</p><br>

                        <p>The warranty covers all components and all defects in materials and manufacturing. Should a failure occur in any of the components, including the springs, basic construction or the cover, Somnium will gladly repair or replace, at our option, your mattress and/or box and/or cover. You will be asked only to cover the cost of shipping and handling. This warranty is not transferable.</p><br>

                        <p>For warranty purposes, 'defective' is defined as: 1) A mattress core exhibiting separation of the laminated components; or 2) An area of compression in excess of 1‚Äù when compared with edge height when the mattress is placed on a solid, flat surface; or 3) Cover failure associated with defective materials or faulty workmanship; or 4) Spring failure associated with defective materials or faulty workmanship.</p><br>

                        <p>Repair or replacement of the mattress or foundation does not extend this warranty or begin a new warranty period. When making a claim against this warranty, you will be required to produce an acceptable copy of proof of purchase and return the defective item, delivery pre-paid, accompanied by a valid return order to a Somnium warehouse.</p><br>

                        <p>This warranty is exclusive and is in lieu of any other warranty, representation, indemnity, or guarantee whether expressed or implied, oral or written, arising by law, custom, or prior policy made or offered by Somnium, it's dealers, representatives, or employees.</p><br>

                        <p>Purchaser acknowledges, by placing the Somnium mattress into use, that this warranty specifically excludes claims for incidental damages or loss and is valid only to the original purchaser.</p><br>

                        <p>High concentrations of chlorine bleach and/or chlorinated disinfectants will degrade textile surfaces. Damage associated with the accumulated build up of chlorine ions will invalidate the warranty. When chlorine based cleaning products are used, they must be thoroughly rinsed with clear water after the required wet contact period.</p><br>

                        <p>The mattress must be protected from physical damage and abuse. Mechanical tearing, puncturing, cutting, or abrading will invalidate the warranty, as will storing the mattress vertically, bending it, or jumping on it. Using the mattress on an adjustable bed or placing it inside a bed frame or on any other base that supplies an uneven resting surface will also void the warranty. The cover must be intact and in use at all times. The continued use of mattresses with defective, damaged, or excessively worn covers will invalidate the mattress core warranty as will continued use of the mattress on an unsuitable base. This limited warranty gives you specific legal rights. You may also have other rights that vary from state to state.
