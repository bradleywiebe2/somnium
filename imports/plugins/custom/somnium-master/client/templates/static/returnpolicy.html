                        <p>Sales processed through our website, (insert store link) give customers the opportunity to test a mattress for a ten-day period after delivery and return it to us for a full refund (less all shipping and handling charges) for any reason if they are not completely satisfied with their purchase. Any return request must be made in writing and be received by Somnium within the ten-day period through our website contact form, via email to office@somniumbeds.com, or at our mailing address at P.O. BOX 1804, Venice, CA 90294. Proof of purchase must accompany the return request.</p><br>

                        <p>The product will be assigned a return order and then needs to be returned to a Somnium warehouse, shipping pre-paid, in its original packaging and like-new condition. Any product not meeting these criteria will be refused.</p><br>

                        <p>Please note: This exception to our retail return policy covers manufacturer direct sales through this site only and explicitly excludes sales through other retailers, websites, affiliates or other agents.</p><br>
