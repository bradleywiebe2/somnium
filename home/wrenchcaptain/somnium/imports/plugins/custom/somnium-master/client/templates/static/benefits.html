                            <p>Our beds are zoned for your comfort with two different firmness grades of springs in different parts of the bed. Somnium is the only mattress that truly reconciles human anatomy and human ergonomics, and we do it by using different firmness grades of springs in different parts of the bed.</p>

                            <p>On a Somnium bed you will never feel any motion transfer thanks to our innovative springs. Connected at the center - rather than the top and bottom in the manner traditional coils have done for centuries - each of our springs moves individually allowing you to move without disturbing your partner. </p>

                            <p>Our high-tech materials make the Somnium dramatically lighter so you can tuck sheets or flip your mattress with ease. Eliminating the heavy metal coils and unnecessary bulk of a traditional mattress allowed us to build a sleek 8-inch profile mattress with a fraction of its predecessor's weight.</p>

                            <p>It's all about the air. Every part of our mattress has been designed to create a well-vented and temperature-controlled environment. From our springs, to our open-pore structure foam, to our zippered cover made out of breathable fabric, our mattress is as air-permeable as possible.</p>

                            <p>Every component of our mattress can be recycled or repurposed once you are ready to part with it. Used mattresses are a huge problem in landfills because they are hard to break down and sheer impossible to dismantle. Somnium begs to differ. Saving the world in your sleep is possible after all.</p>

                        <p>Our covers simply zip off so the fibers can be recycled and the soy-blend foam can easily be stripped away to be turned into yoga mats, insulation or carpet underlay. Even our high-tech springs enjoy a useful afterlife: Once ground up, their high-quality elastomer is reborn as a kid's toy.</p><br><br>
